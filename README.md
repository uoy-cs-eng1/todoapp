# Engineering 1

In this repository you will find source code used in the context of the 2nd year Software Engineering module (Engineering 1) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk).

## Project IDE import

When importing the project into your IDE, make sure that the src folder (todoapp/src) is recognised as a Java source folder. Some IDEs like IntelliJ will not recursively look through the file structure to find a source folder, if it is not on the top (root) level of the imported project. If you are using IntelliJ, open the src folder of the project to solve this.

All source code in this repository is made available under the [Eclipse Public License v 2.0](LICENSE).
